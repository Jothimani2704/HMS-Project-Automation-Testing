Automation Testing Report – HealFlow (Hospital Management System - Outpatient Management)
# Project Overview
* Project Name: HealFlow Hospital Management System (HMS)
* Testing Type: End-to-End Automation Testing
* Company Name: Healflow
* Domain: Healthcare (Hospital Management)

# Tools & Frameworks Used:
* IDE: Visual Studio 2022
* Programming Language: .NET (C#)
* Test Framework: NUnit
* Automation Tool: Selenium
* Design Pattern: Page Object Model (POM)

# Browsers Tested:
* Chrome,
* Edge
* Firefox
# Test Environment:
* OS: Windows 11
* Database: PG Admin

# Objective
* The objective of this automation testing was to validate the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the Hospital Management system, focusing on inpatient management. This testing process aimed to:
* Verify Core Functionalities: Ensure seamless operations of patient registration, appointment scheduling, billing, staff management, and hospital administration.
* Enhance System Reliability: Automate critical workflows to reduce manual intervention, increase efficiency, and ensure consistent system performance.
* Ensure Data Integrity: Validate data accuracy across modules, including patient records, billing transactions, staff assignments, and medical reports.
* Identify and Report Defects: Detect functional, UI, and performance-related defects to improve system quality and ensure a smooth user experience.
* Ensure Role-Based Access Control: Verify that role permissions (Doctors, Nurses, Receptionists, Admins) are enforced correctly across the application.
* Improve Patient Experience: Test functionalities like appointment scheduling, patient token generation, lab test processing, and invoice generation for efficiency.
* Enable Cross-Browser Compatibility: Validate the system’s responsiveness and UI consistency across different browsers, including Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.
* Support Future Scalability: Establish a robust automation framework to streamline future enhancements and feature updates.
